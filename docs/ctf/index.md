# CTF - Capture The Flag

**Capture The Flag (CTF)** challenges are interactive cybersecurity competitions where participants solve puzzles or exploit vulnerabilities to `capture flags` â€” secret tokens hidden in systems or applications.

CTFs come in many forms, from beginner-friendly puzzle solving to advanced penetration testing exercises. They help develop critical skills such as:

- Linux command-line proficiency
- Network analysis
- Cryptography and encoding/decoding
- Web and binary exploitation
- Problem-solving and logical thinking

By participating in CTFs, learners gain hands-on experience that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world security challenges.
