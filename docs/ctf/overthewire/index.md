# OverTheWire - Cyber War Games

**OverTheWire** is a free online platform that offers interactive cybersecurity challenges, known as **wargames**, to help learners build practical skills in areas like Linux command line usage, networking, privilege escalation, cryptography, and hacking techniques. Designed for beginners and aspiring ethical hackers, the platform features progressively difficult levels where users connect to remote servers (usually via SSH) and solve puzzles using real-world tools and logic. The most popular starting point is the Bandit wargame, which introduces users to Linux basics in a safe, legal, and hands-on environment.
